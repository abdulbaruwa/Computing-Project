Learning Aim B and C
Design and develop a computer game to meet client requirements
Overview of tasks to complete project
-              Designs
o             High level design documentation of game
             Imagine you have to outsource the building of this game to a company in India. This design document is what you will give to them.
•             Vision, mechanics of the game, 

-              Feedback on designs
o             Get feedback from friends, teachers and someone with industry experience. 
-              Development of the game modules
-              Iterative development of the following modules as highlighted in the game design document. 
o             Bird Flight
o             Scrolling Background
o             Obstacle Placement
o             Collision Detection
o             Death
o             Character Creation

-              Testing of the game
o             Unit testing – detection logic, flight path algorithm
o             Functional testing – playing the game with integrated modules
Gantt Chart will go here.

Test Plan

1.            Has Pygame been imported?
2.            Window dimensions are a sensible size?
3.            Images loaded properly
4.            Controls working
5.            Score counter functioning properly
6.            Collision detection
7.            Music plays when the game starts and stops when game ends.

(More will be added here)

After each test is done, there should be an explanation of the expected outcome and actual outcome. As well as the action taken to fix the problem (generally we create new tests to replicate problems and code to fix them).


Game Overview
2D side scrolling game – with the objective to get the highest score possible. Has collectibles to increase the score counter.
Lose condition – Hits taken by the player by obstacles during gameplay.
Win condition – Game is endless so there is no way to ‘beat the game’. However, having a high score table would allow competition between people. 

Design Research

Here I need to show the initial design of the game.
Explain the basic mechanics of the game – e.g Controls, how does the score counter increase. Aim for the game.
What inspired me to design the game the way I did.


Suitable Platforms for the game

PCs and Laptops – easy distribution, low system requirements to run the game
Explain why you haven’t considered other platforms such as a console. E.g. - game is too basic to require the power of the console.

Software used to develop the game
-              Python and Pygame Module.

Explain the positives and negatives of me using Python and how using pygame made the process of developing the game easier.

Performance of the game on the platform
Explain how fast the game runs on PC, talk about any performance issues and optimisations which must be made to allow the game run efficiently.


Review client requirements of the game

Discuss how the game meets my target range of everybody – Talk about the simplicity of the game and how anyone can easily get started.

Conclusion
Explain how I got to my final product and how I considered all of the feedback to improve and optimise the game.

General Algorithm of the game
Write out how the game would run in basic steps.
