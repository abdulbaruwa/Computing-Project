# Computing-Project - Name TBD (Flappy Bird Clone)

For my BTEC Computing Project, I am developing a Flappy Bird clone in pygame.

There are currently 6 tasks which need to be developed for me to complete this game.
  1. Scrolling Background.
  2. Bird Flight
  3. Obstacle Placement
  4. Collison
  5. Death
  6. Scoring
  7. Addition of Levels (Extra)
  8. Creation of a character.
  

  First stage of development - Scrolling background.
  
  Since I am creating a flappy bird clone. The first thing I noticed with the game was the fact that it had a parallax effect. I collected 2 images. The skyline where you can see the buildings in the distanc andthe actual foreground.
  The skyline background would move the slowest to give the player the impression that there is considerable distance between skyline and foreground. Then the foreground background would move the fastest to show that player is moving at a reasonable speed over the ground
 
 
 Second stage of development - Animation of sprites
 
 To show movement of the character I need sprites. Sprites are individual images which was layered they convey the impression of movement similar to a filpbook.
 As a testing each stage of development individually I collected a 5 images of a characters walking sprite and programmed them to cycle through every image after every 1/4 of second. I chose this time so that the images can flow nicely without any lag
 
 
  
  Note. After each stage of development, Make sure to record it,
